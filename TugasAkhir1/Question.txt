Question 1: 
	What is scale? -> scale is each level of decomposition in wavelet transform.
	How to compute variance in each state?, compute it in each scale.

---------

Question 2:
	What are the Wavelet Coefficients?, are they simply the pixel value of the decomposed image?
	-> Wavelet Coefficients are the result of pairing up and sum the neighbouring pixels and divide by square root of 2.

---------
Question 3: 
	Do we include the LL while measuring the probability of State variable in coarsest scale?
